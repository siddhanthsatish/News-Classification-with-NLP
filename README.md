# News-Classification-with-NLP
News and media have become an integral part of people's views and opinions in our society. News reporting has developed so much in the 21st century that there's much more content out there on each news platform. This provides news platforms a new challenge of classifying the news in the right way. It is important to improve this classification to recommend the right news for the user. To do this, we need to uncover which algorithms work best for classification, which categories are being confused the most, and least to improve our classification task substantially. In this paper, we are testing our data on a robust array of classification algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forests Classifier, Support Vector Machines. Post classification, we are finding the answers to our research questions through the confusion matrix of our best-performing model.
